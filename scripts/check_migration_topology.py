"""Alembic revision-graph fitness checks (author-time fork guard).

Run by ``make lint`` (architecture-check). Stdlib only: it reads
``app/db/alembic/versions/*.py`` with ``ast`` instead of booting Alembic, so it
needs neither a database URL nor an importable app, and it runs in the Lint job
on every backend PR.

Why it exists: on 2026-09-11 ``20260910_010000_add_dashboard_auth_providers``
and ``20260910_010000_dashboard_spool_retention`` were authored on different
branches, took the *same* timestamp slot, and descended from different parents.
Both PRs were green, and once both landed on ``main`` every job that migrates a
database failed with ``alembic.script.revision.MultipleHeads`` (Playwright, Helm
smoke, unit, all integration-core shards, both PostgreSQL suites) until #2368
(``53f968723``) added an empty merge revision. Nothing surfaced the fork while
the PRs were open: ``_collect_migration_policy_violations`` in
``app/db/migrate.py`` reports ``alembic_head_count_invalid`` only when both
parents already sit in one tree, and CI is not re-triggered when the base
branch advances under an already-green head.

Checks:

1. The revision graph is one connected acyclic lineage: exactly one head, exactly
   one base, no duplicate ids, no ``down_revision`` naming a revision that does
   not exist, no cycle, and nothing the head does not descend from (error). Same
   invariant as ``alembic_head_count_invalid`` plus the shapes the head and base
   counts cannot see, minus the database: ``make lint`` on a branch that is
   merged/rebased onto current ``main`` fails before the push.
2. No two revisions share a ``YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`` timestamp prefix (error,
   ratcheted -- see ``RATCHET_PREFIX``). The collision is the authoring-time
   fingerprint of the incident: two authors picking the same slot means either
   the graph forks (different parents) or filename order no longer implies
   graph order (chained). The message names both revisions with their
   ``down_revision``s so the fork is visible without opening the files.
3. A revision's id matches its filename stem and the shared revision-id format
   (error, whole history). Mirrors the runtime policy's
   ``alembic_revision_filename_mismatch`` / ``alembic_revision_id_format_invalid``
   so a mismatch fails in Lint instead of only in the migrating jobs.
4. A revision's timestamp prefix is not older than its parent's (warning,
   ratcheted). Order inversions are legal for Alembic but make the filename
   ordering lie; they are a *warning*, not an error, because the common cause is
   the sanctioned "re-point ``down_revision`` after main moved" rebase and the
   fix (renaming the revision) is only free before the revision ships.
5. Branch fork against a base ref (error, skipped when the ref is absent): a
   revision this checkout adds on top of ``--base-ref`` must descend from a head
   of that ref, not from a revision the base ref has already built on. The base
   ref's own ``down_revision`` edges are read out of git (two plumbing calls, no
   network), because a branch that has not rebased does not contain the revision
   ``main`` added -- only ``main``'s copy can prove the parent is no longer its
   head. This is the only check that sees the fork from the *branch alone*,
   before a rebase or a merge ref brings both parents into one tree. Merge
   revisions (more than one parent) are exempt: merging two heads is exactly how
   a fork is repaired. Skipped in CI, where the checkout has no ``origin/main``
   -- there the ``pull_request`` merge ref makes check 1 equivalent.

Exit codes: 0 = clean (warnings allowed), 1 = violations, 2 = config error.
